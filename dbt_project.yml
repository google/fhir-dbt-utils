  # FHIR data format
  fhir_version: "STU3"  # Version of FHIR that your data conforms to. [string]
  snake_case_fhir_tables: TRUE  # TRUE if your FHIR database tables are in snake case (e.g. allergy_intolerance). [boolean]
  multiple_tables_per_resource: FALSE  # TRUE if your database can contain more than one table per FHIR resources which should be unioned. [boolean]
  assume_resources_exist: FALSE  # TRUE if you want to always assume that FHIR resources exist in your database rather than relying on logic within the fhir_resource_exists macro. [boolean]
  assume_fields_exist: FALSE  # TRUE if you want to always assume that fields exists in a FHIR resource rather than relying on logic within the field_exists macro. [boolean]
